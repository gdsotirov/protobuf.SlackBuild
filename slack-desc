protobuf: Protobuf (Google's data interchange format)
protobuf:
protobuf: Protocol buffers (a.k.a., protobuf) are Google's language-neutral,
protobuf: platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured
protobuf: data - think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how
protobuf: you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special
protobuf: generated source code to easily write and read your structured data
protobuf: to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of
protobuf: languages (C++, Java and Python). You can even update your data
protobuf: structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled
protobuf: against the "old" format.
