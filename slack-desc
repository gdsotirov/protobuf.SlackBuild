protobuf: generated source code to easily write and read your structured data
protobuf: to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of
protobuf: languages (C++, Java, Python, Objective-C, C#, Javascript, Ruby, Go
protobuf: and PHP). You can even update your data structure without breaking
protobuf: deployed programs that are compiled against the "old" format.
